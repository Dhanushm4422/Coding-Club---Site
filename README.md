<h2 align="center">‚ÑπÔ∏è About Coding Club CITK</h2>
Everybody should learn to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.

Being Coding Club of a technical institution, we do each and every stuff related to coding. Coding events, Workshops, Query sessions, contests are just to name a few. We believe in " Coding like poetry should be short and concise. Spreading knowledge and growing of competitive coding culture is at the root of the existence of this club. We provide a mutual helping platform for the students and guide them in their journey of programming."

Although the club has been functioning quite well as compared to other clubs, still, a lot of things needs to be done. Some great initiatives were taken by the current secretaries, including the formation of smaller groups focussed on specific areas (competitive programming group, development group and machine learning group) and the fresher's mentorship program. Still there are lot of things that the club can improve upon. We hope that we are able to take this momentum forward.
